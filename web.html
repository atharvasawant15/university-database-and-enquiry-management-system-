 KJSIEIT abides by the vision of its founder Padmabhushan Pujya (late) Shri. Karamshi J Somaiya, who set up the K J Somaiya Trust in 1951. He envisaged that the Somaiya group of Institutions must be recognized as the ‘Nalanda’ of learning where students and teachers work in an integral ambience for the betterment and upliftment of our society.

Later, Shri. Karmshibhai laid the foundation for Somaiya Vidyavihar in 1959 which has grown into large educational complex with 34 institutions catering to diverse fields of education in Science and Humanities, Engineering, Education, Medicine, Management, Mass Communication etc. with more than 26000 students and 1200 teaching faculty.

      The KJSIEIT library is privileged to support the institute’s progress towards its vision and mission. It has built-up area of approx. 410 Sq. Meters, it has the sitting capacity of 100 students. Library is ‘Heart’ of the institute.
Heart pumps out blood whereas library pumps out information which facilitates the teaching and learning process.

Libraries are, in a certain sense, a microcosm of our world where ideas propagate and cultures surround them, while at the same time libraries are also extensions of each individual that seeks knowledge - whether for amusement, practical need, inspiration or even to help them teach others. KJSIEIT Library is functional to cater needs of its patrons

      Hostels for students reflect corporate fitness in design and functionality, with separate infrastructure for men and women. The campus hostels are again an opportunity for cross integration of student learning with corporate life where the student is able to share knowledge and learn from his mentors the workplace competencies.
